#	Check OS X Caching Server
#	by Jedda Wignall
#	http://jedda.me

#	v1.1 - 17 Mar 2013
#	Fixed quotation marks in databasePath (line 72) so that custom paths with spacing will work.
#	v1.0 - 17 Dec 2012
#	Initial release.

#	Script that uses serveradmin to check that the OS X Caching service is listed as running.
#	If all is OK, it returns performance data for the size and limits of cached content, number of cached packages and
#	bytes requested by and returned from the service.

#	Example:
#	./check_osx_caching.sh

#	Performance Data - this script returns the followng Nagios performance data:
#	reservedSpace -		Space reserved by the caching service for cache use.
#	cacheUsed -			Space currently used by all cached content.
#	cacheFree -			Space available for new cached content.
#	cacheLimit -		User defined limit for cache in Server.app. If unlimited, free space on the selected volume.
#	bytesRequested -	Bytes requested FROM APPLE for content. (Downloads from Apple's servers).
#	bytesReturned -		Bytes returned TO CLIENTS for content. (Cached content, as well as real-time downloads from Apple's servers).
#	numberOfPkgs -		Number of packages currently cached by the service.

#	Compatibility - this script has been tested on and functions on the following stock OSes:
#	10.8.2+ Server with Server.app 2.2+
